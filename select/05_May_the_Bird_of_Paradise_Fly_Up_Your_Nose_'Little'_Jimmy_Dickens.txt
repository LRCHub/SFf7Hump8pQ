One fine day
As I was walkin' down the street
Spied a beggar man
With rags upon his feet
Took a penny from my pocket
In his tin cup I did drop it
And I heard him say
As I made my retreat:

"May the bird of paradise fly up your nose!
"May an elephant crush you with his toes"
"May your wife be plagued with runners in her hose"
"May the bird of paradise fly up your nose!"

My laundry man
Is really on his toes
Found a hundred dollar bill
Among my clothes
When he called me I came runnin'
Gave him back his dime for phonin'
And I heard him say as I turned to go

"May the bird of paradise fly up your nose!
"May an elephant crush you with his toes"
"May your wife be plagued with runners in her hose"
"May the bird of paradise fly up your nose!"

I was way behind
One day to catch a train
The taxi driver said:
"We'll make it just the same!"
A speed cop met up with us
And as he wrote out the ticket
I stood by politely waiting for my change

"May the bird of paradise fly up your nose!
"May an elephant crush you with his toes"
"May your wife be plagued with runners in her hose"
"May the bird of paradise fly up your nose!"

"May the bird of paradise fly up your nose!
"May an elephant crush you with his toes"
"May your wife be plagued with runners in her hose"
"May the bird of paradise fly up your nose!"

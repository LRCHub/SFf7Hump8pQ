Honestly, I can't believe the magic you do.
Never seen anything as lovely as you.
I was so afraid.
I was so alone an' blue.
I took you in my arms.
Now I'm goin' home with you.

I'm gonna wake up in your arms tomorrow.
You gonna make it the night of my life.
I'm gonna wake up in your arms tomorrow.
Thank you for takin' me to paradise tonight.

Instrumental break.

I was so afraid.
I was so alone an' blue.
An' I took you in my arms.
Now I'm goin' home with you.

I'm gonna wake up in your arms tomorrow.
You gonna make it the night of my life.
I'm gonna wake up in your arms tomorrow.
Thank you for takin' me to paradise tonight.

Ooh, so this is paradise.
Ooh, so this is paradise,
Paradise all night.

I'm gonna wake up in your arms tomorrow.
You gonna make it the night of my life.
I'm gonna wake up in your arms tomorrow.
Thank you for takin' me to paradise tonight.

Ooh, so this is paradise.
Ooh, so this is paradise,
Paradise all night.

I'm gonna wake up in your arms tomorrow.
You gonna make it the night of my life.
I'm gonna wake up in your arms tomorrow.
Thank you for takin' me to paradise tonight.

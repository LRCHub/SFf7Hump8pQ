There's trouble in paradise
I can see it and I know the signs so well
I know he's out there and around it every day

There's trouble but there won't be long
'Cause in the morning it'll all be gone
Long gone, 'cause Lord I'm gonna love him
Till the devil goes away

Now I know about those devil women
They'll set your lovers head to spinning
And she's a demon she wants control
But she ain't taken my mans soul
She ain't taken my mans soul

There's trouble in paradise
I can see it and I know the signs so well
I know he's out there and around it every day

There's trouble but there won't be long
'Cause in the morning it'll all be gone
Long gone, 'cause Lord I'm gonna love him
Till the devil goes away

There's trouble in paradise
Lord I'm gonna love him
Till the devil goes away
